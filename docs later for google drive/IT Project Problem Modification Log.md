## IT Project Problem Modification Log



### 0815

- consisting of # of modules, and by the time (end of October)
- The demo is required in November
- authentication system — log in/out features
- Storage - 
- what type of docs are we storing
- tagging and searching — what kind of search? (concrete/date/...)
  - make an agreement
- Suggestion: negotiate with the client



- Scope is from the requirement — we NEED a requirement list!!!!
- it would be better to write a project background
  - Pink point: client wants but not existing in the industry
  - why is choosing the system: introduction
  - role description
    - Agile — 2 main roles
    - Focus more on the programming and the testing
  - product backlog: **user stories**
- **PRODUCT BACKLOG**
  - whole list in the system that contains all the features
  - in each sprint we take out the features and finish them
  - **Sprint backlog**
  - **USER STORIES**
    - Things that you want to achieve
    - review all the application
    - need to think what is the role to conduct that action
      - I want to achieve blablabla
- client communication minite 
- Team meeting needs to be documented
  - agender
  - meeting notes (outcome, memtioned, notes, answers)
  - when / who / ..
- from next week, "WHAT WE HAVE MENTIONED" 
  - what I've done
  - what im doing
  - what im going to do
  - **(scrum master- balance the workload!!!!)**



- Extra: update the info with github

### 0819

Improvement: 

1. Grammar mistake

2. ambiguous thing exists:

   1. the third line and the forth line

      1. we have to exactly name the thing we store (docs/ pics/ mp4/..)

   2. add-on for project scope:

      1. project background
         1. for those who knows nothing before the proejct
         2. the current solution of the problem (given for 2.1.1)
         3. what we want to solve

   3. client communication

      1. the client requirement list 

         separate those two

         1. Functional-requirement

            1. need to construct into user story

         2. non-functional requirement

            (Nothing for coding to )

            1. something that related to the performance
               1. e.g. android system
               2. Security 
            2. simplicity about the design rather than the development
               1. family trees

      2. client communication:

         1. not all the questions are required
         2. before **workshop2** it is needed to be complete

      3. for those those who is not scrum or PO:

         1. search the guideline of the elder-using apps

   4. User story is not completed

      1. User story suggestion is provided
      2. features of our system (table: 2 column —— 1U.S. 2 Acceptance criteria)
         1. Purpose: whenever US compete, do the test of 2, then **present** the work to the client
            1. end of sprint 2, finish N features (e.g. 3), test, present, then meeting, to ask if the client is satified with the current not completed product
            2. ensure the features 
            3.  test the actual application
            4. it is called sprint review (client — product owner)
         2. client should have the accptance criteria of the features
            1. e.g. private space — correspond feature
            2. ask for the **correct behavior**
               1. put into the acceptance criteria
               2. dont have to focus on the type of users

   5. **rename the google drive**

   6. team profile (**folders**)

   7. non-functional requirement is not documented in google drive

      1. only in **requirement list**

      

### 0822

- product backlog, degital design, git repo set up, architecture design
- finalise architecture design **by end of next week**
- things to follow:
  - agile process — slice 3 of ppt
  - now we are at: based on Product backlog, do the Sprint Backlog
  - 

- sprint planning
  - define our sprint goal
  - estimate the user story at the product backlog
  - 1. Estimate item of story — define how big is the story
       1. planning poker — need everyone to do so 
          1. assigning number to the user story
          2. n hour of work for 1 person
          3. not assigning a continous number
          4. we use **Fibonacci** number: 1,2,3,5,8,..
          5. "scrum poker link"
       2. After finish planing, for each sprint we need to take user story from PB to SB
          1. need to break down user story to **story point**
             1. front end task
             2. Back end task
             3. testing task
          2. "what is the proper number of the user story to take to the SB"
             1. have a formula for the first sprint
             2. e.g. 10hr per week — how many things could be conducted within the time
             3. not using formula after sprint 1
             4. we see the actual time and change the time (e.g. 45 hrs)
             5. assign the task to the **person**
             6. at the **trello board** 
                1. **scrum master** set the task and the estimated finished time
             7. could be small task pieces
             8. as long as the tasks are related to the user story
             9. estimation for the class
             10. assigner: **reporter**: feedback and evaluation
             11. accpentance quiteria
       3. **sprint planning** is needed at the board
          1. finished before the sprint
             1. **before week 6**
             2. week 6-9 finish all the
          2. "what is working, what needs to be improved"
             1. Start doing
             2. Stop doing
             3. continue doing
       4. **sprint review** — show case meeting — with client
          1. represent to the client what we have achieved
          2. since have not much development:
             1. represent to the digital prototype
             2. collect info from the client
             3. since the client have no technical background:
                1. present things that is visible
                2. Enough for us to test the user story
